Comprehensive Guide to 6v6 PvP Battles in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen

This guide provides an exhaustive explanation of the rules governing 6v6 PvP battles in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, focusing exclusively on the mechanics of these Generation III games. It covers the structure of turns, actions that consume a turn, rules for switching Pokémon, and includes detailed case scenarios to illustrate battle progression. Per the requirements, this guide omits any mechanics from newer generations and excludes the use of items or bags, aligning with standard competitive PvP settings where such features are disabled.

Overview of 6v6 PvP Battles

A 6v6 PvP battle, also known as a Full Battle, is a competitive match between two Trainers, each commanding a team of six Pokémon. The objective is to knock out all of the opponent’s Pokémon, with the first Trainer to achieve this declared the winner. These battles are typically conducted via link battles using the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, as described in the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen documentation (Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen - Bulbapedia). Key characteristics include:





No External Rewards: Unlike in-game battles, PvP battles do not award experience points, Effort Values (EVs), friendship changes, or money.



No Pokédex Registration: Pokémon seen in battle are not added to the Pokédex.



Item Restrictions: In standard competitive PvP, items and bags are disabled to ensure fair play, focusing solely on Pokémon moves and strategies.



Battle Conclusion: The battle ends when one Trainer’s entire team of six Pokémon faints, or if a Trainer concedes (though conceding is not formally supported in-game and typically results in a loss).

These battles emphasize strategic planning, leveraging Pokémon types, moves, and switching to outmaneuver the opponent.

Turn Structure

Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen battles are turn-based, with both Trainers selecting actions simultaneously for their active Pokémon. The execution order of these actions is determined by a combination of move priority and Pokémon Speed, as outlined in the general Pokémon battle mechanics (Pokémon Battle - Bulbapedia).

Action Selection

At the start of each turn, Trainers choose one of two actions for their active Pokémon:





Use a Move: Select a move from the Fight menu, which includes both attacking moves (e.g., Thunderbolt) and status moves (e.g., Growl).



Switch Pokémon: Replace the active Pokémon with another from the party.

These choices are made without knowledge of the opponent’s action, adding a predictive element to strategy.

Execution Order

The order in which actions are executed follows these rules:





Move Priority: Each move has a priority value, typically ranging from -6 to +6. Higher-priority moves are executed first. For example, Quick Attack (+1 priority) goes before Tackle (0 priority). A list of move priorities can be found in the Generation III mechanics (Generation III - Bulbapedia).



Speed: If moves have the same priority, the Pokémon with the higher Speed stat acts first. Speed is a base stat modified by factors like paralysis (which reduces Speed by 25%).



Tiebreaker: If both priority and Speed are equal, the Pokémon that was sent out first (i.e., earlier in the battle) acts first.

Turn Resolution

Once actions are selected, they are resolved in order based on the above criteria. Damage, status effects, and other outcomes (e.g., fainting) are applied immediately. If a Pokémon faints, the Trainer must switch to another Pokémon before the turn ends, which does not consume a turn.

Actions That Take a Turn

In a 6v6 PvP battle, certain actions consume a Trainer’s turn, while others do not. The following table summarizes the actions relevant to FireRed and LeafGreen PvP battles:







Action



Takes a Turn?



Details





Using a Move



Yes



Includes attacking moves (e.g., Thunderbolt) and status moves (e.g., Growl). If no PP remains, the Pokémon uses Struggle, a weak move that damages the user.





Switching Pokémon



Yes



Voluntarily switching to another Pokémon consumes the turn, with the new Pokémon acting in the next turn.





Running Away



N/A



Not applicable in PvP battles, as running results in a loss and is disabled.

Notes





Struggle: If a Pokémon has no PP for any of its moves, it automatically uses Struggle, a Normal-type move with 50 base power that deals recoil damage equal to 1/4 of the damage inflicted.



No Items: As specified, items and bags are not used in standard PvP battles, so actions related to item usage are excluded.

Switching Pokémon

Switching Pokémon is a critical strategic decision that can shift the battle’s momentum. The rules for switching in FireRed and LeafGreen are as follows:

When Can a Trainer Switch?





Voluntary Switch: At the start of a turn, a Trainer can select the Pokémon menu to switch their active Pokémon with another from their party. This action takes a turn, meaning the new Pokémon enters the field but cannot act until the next turn.



Forced Switch:





Fainting: If a Pokémon faints, the Trainer must immediately select another Pokémon with remaining HP to continue the battle. This switch occurs before the turn ends and does not take a turn.



Move-Induced: Certain moves, such as Roar or Whirlwind, force the opponent’s Pokémon to switch out, randomly selecting another Pokémon from their party with HP remaining. This forced switch does not consume a turn for the affected Trainer.

How Switching Affects Turn Order

In FireRed and LeafGreen, switching occurs before the turn ends, which has strategic implications:





Voluntary Switch: If a Trainer switches Pokémon, the opponent’s action (if a move) targets the Pokémon being replaced before the new one enters. For example, if Trainer A switches from Pikachu to Charmander and Trainer B uses Vine Whip, Vine Whip hits Pikachu before Charmander appears.



Forced Switch: If a Pokémon faints or is forced out by a move like Roar, the new Pokémon is sent out immediately, and the turn continues with any remaining actions.

Special Cases





Pursuit: The move Pursuit deals double damage (from 40 to 80 base power) if used against a Pokémon that is switching out voluntarily in the same turn, making it a powerful counter to predicted switches.



Battle End: If all six Pokémon on one side faint, the battle ends, and no further switching is possible.

Case Scenarios

To demonstrate how 6v6 PvP battles unfold, the following scenarios provide turn-by-turn examples, showcasing various mechanics such as move priority, Speed, switching, fainting, and forced switches.

Scenario 1: Basic Turn with Move Priority and Speed





Setup: Trainer A has Pikachu (Speed 90, moves: Thunderbolt, Quick Attack). Trainer B has Bulbasaur (Speed 45, moves: Vine Whip, Razor Leaf).



Turn 1:





Actions: Trainer A selects Thunderbolt (priority 0). Trainer B selects Quick Attack (priority 1).



Resolution: Quick Attack’s higher priority means Bulbasaur acts first, using Quick Attack to deal damage to Pikachu. Then, Pikachu uses Thunderbolt, dealing super-effective damage to Bulbasaur due to its Electric-type advantage against Grass.



Turn 2:





Actions: Trainer A switches to Charmander (Speed 65). Trainer B selects Vine Whip (priority 0).



Resolution: Switching takes a turn, so Bulbasaur uses Vine Whip on Pikachu before Charmander enters, dealing super-effective damage. Charmander is now active for the next turn.

Scenario 2: Switching and Fainting





Setup: Trainer A has Charmander (Speed 65, moves: Flamethrower, Ember). Trainer B has Bulbasaur (Speed 45, moves: Vine Whip, Razor Leaf).



Turn 3:





Actions: Trainer A selects Flamethrower. Trainer B selects Vine Whip.



Resolution: Charmander’s higher Speed means it uses Flamethrower first, dealing super-effective damage and knocking out Bulbasaur. Trainer B must switch to Ivysaur (Speed 60) without taking a turn.



Turn 4:





Actions: Trainer A selects Ember. Trainer B selects Razor Leaf.



Resolution: Charmander acts first (Speed 65 vs. 60), using Ember on Ivysaur, dealing Fire-type damage. Ivysaur then uses Razor Leaf, dealing super-effective Grass-type damage to Charmander.

Scenario 3: Forced Switch with Roar





Setup: Trainer A has Charizard (Speed 100, moves: Flamethrower, Roar). Trainer B has Ivysaur (Speed 60, moves: Razor Leaf, Sleep Powder).



Turn 5:





Actions: Trainer A selects Roar. Trainer B selects Razor Leaf.



Resolution: Charizard’s higher Speed means it uses Roar first, forcing Ivysaur to switch out. Trainer B’s Ivysaur is replaced by Venusaur (Speed 80) without taking a turn. Razor Leaf is not used, as Ivysaur is no longer active.



Turn 6:





Actions: Trainer A selects Flamethrower. Trainer B selects Solar Beam.



Resolution: Charizard acts first (Speed 100 vs. 80), using Flamethrower on Venusaur, dealing super-effective damage. Venusaur begins charging Solar Beam, a two-turn move, and will attack on the next turn if not interrupted.

Scenario 4: Status Conditions and Fainting





Setup: Trainer A has Charizard (Speed 100, moves: Flamethrower, Dragon Claw). Trainer B has Venusaur (Speed 80, moves: Sleep Powder, Razor Leaf).



Turn 7:





Actions: Trainer A selects Flamethrower. Trainer B selects Sleep Powder.



Resolution: Charizard acts first, using Flamethrower to deal significant Fire-type damage to Venusaur. Venusaur uses Sleep Powder, putting Charizard to sleep, preventing it from acting in subsequent turns until it wakes up.



Turn 8:





Actions: Trainer A switches to Blastoise (Speed 78). Trainer B selects Razor Leaf.



Resolution: Venusaur acts first (as Charizard is asleep and switching takes a turn), using Razor Leaf on Charizard before Blastoise enters, dealing Grass-type damage. Blastoise is now active.



Turn 9:





Actions: Trainer A selects Hydro Pump. Trainer B selects Razor Leaf.



Resolution: Venusaur acts first (Speed 80 vs. 78), using Razor Leaf on Blastoise, dealing super-effective damage due to its Grass-type advantage against Water. Hydro Pump misses due to its low accuracy (80%), ending the turn without damage.
